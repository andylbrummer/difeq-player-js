#difeq-player-js

This is a widget that displays differential equations using an view similar to [http://hint.fm/wind/](http://hint.fm/wind/ "wind map"). There are buttons to start and stop the animation, create a screen shot, and to go full screen. 

The project is based on angular directives, using a bootstrap slider, and the bootstrap icon font for button images.

#Examples

You can find examples of the widget on the demo [page](https://github.com/andylbrummer/difeq-player-js).
